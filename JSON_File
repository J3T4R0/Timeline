This government had expanded rights and suffrage where the poor people could elect plebeians to represent them in the government.

The popular culture portrayed a woman as a friendly and nurturing individual left to tend the house, while the men were supposed to work all day.

The increased amount of food allowed for people to have an excess of food, and afford having a child, thus rising the population. The enclosure acts also helped to move people close to cites, as big farm businesses took control of small farms and lands.

The majority of the  population was poor and working class, leading Thomas Malthus to the conclusion that the food supply can not withstand the rising population. An important lesson however, the food supply was maintained by the agricultural revolutions that took place, showing that necessity is the mother of all creation. He also forgot to calibrate that the economy of supply and demand would equate for the lack of farming jobs.  </p>"

By creating a working class that worked for low wages, the economy was able to increase and cities became the central spot for urbanization. As a result, the city became unsanitary, and workers went on to labor unions to increase for improvements in the standard of living. The city increased the standard of living by placing sewers, making paved roads, affording retirement options, and having greater sanitation. </p>"

However, some would view business leaders as “robber barons” because they created monopolies, which took over entire industries and rose prices. Due to the poor wages, long hours, and dangerous counditions the monopolies enforced in the Morganization principle, the workers suffered. By forming labor unions to strike against the big corporations, the government finally regulated the big trust businesses to allow less hours and better wages over a long period of time.</p>"
